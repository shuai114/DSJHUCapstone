After the parade came the Fireworks. Yes, we were super close to the castle, but didn’t want to stay THAT close. We made our way back and then realized our mistake. Main Street was PACKED. A Cast Member holding a light up in the air said, "If you want to watch the Fireworks, follow me…" so we kind of "crowd dove" through a ton of people and she led us to an open patch where no one was standing! Pretty crazy! We were also WAY closer so that Cast Member received a gold star in my opinion!!!
The also mention the effect on the night sky, an issue we raised in our report, which again was ignore by Lancing Parish Council!. "The use of all lighting, including that of the indoor football pitch dome, should be the subject of a planning condition to ensure that it is only utilised at appropriate times and when necessary to safeguard the ‘dark skies' of the adjacent NP."
â€œItâ€™s no costume, Pricklewood, Iâ€™m the real McCoy.â€?I then got down onto the carpet, grasped the feet of the armchair with my toes and lifted it off the ground. â€œHow many humans do you know who can do that?â€?I asked.
At the Spice Merchant, a 2-ounce bag of tea leaves capable of producing 1 gallons of iced tea costs about $2.50.
